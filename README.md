# Neural Style Transfer using pretrained Torchvision model with color transfer!


An implementation of the neural style in PyTorch! This notebook implements [Neural Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) algorithm created by Gatys et al. (2015) and [Preserving Color in Neural Artistic Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.05897.pdf) by Leon Gatys, Matthias Bethge, Aaron Hertzmann, and Eli Shechtman (2016).

The pretrained weights of VGG19 from torchvision models for classification of images were used for this implementation.
